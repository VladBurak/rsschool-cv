Summury
---------
I am in my fourth year student of Belarusian National Technical University, specialty - technological equipment for machine-building production(SolidWorks, NASTRAN,Ansys). I am curious and curiosity led me to develop mobile applications. I am getting a higher education in a completely different specialty, so there was a lot of "different" in the process of learning to program mobile applications and many things did not work out. billions of mobile phones and tens of billions of mobile applications - the realization of this fact blows the mind. this is insanely great. i want to be a part of it.
